			<h2>Roland Schitt, Mayor of Schitt's Creek</h2>
				
			<p>As the proud Mayor of (and part-Motel owner in) Schitt's Creek, I formally invite you to visit our little slice of paradise!</p>

			<p>Schitt's Creek has a little bit of something for everyone. Do you like aesthetic-forward, locally-made hand creams? Shop at the Rose Apothecary! Do you like food? Dine at Twyla's Cafe Tropical! Do you have a car? Maybe Bob can fix it at Bob's Garage!</p>

			<p>And the fun doesn't stop there. Schitt's Creek is home to local celebrities like the <a href="https://youtu.be/biiLQKkNOaU?t=6" target="_blank">Jazzagals</a> (including vocals from Sunrise Bay actress and former LarryAir representative Moira Rose) and Alexis Rose, the singer/songwriter/aspiring PR executive/jet-setter behind the one-hit-wonder "A Little Bit Alexis"! Rest assured that Schitt's Creek is filled with culture and entertainment.</p>

			<p>Book your stay at the Rosebud Motel today and experience all that Schitt's Creek has to offer for yourself!<p>
